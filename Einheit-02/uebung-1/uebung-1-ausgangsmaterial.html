3 Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents

3.2 Elements

3.2.1 Semantics

This section is non-normative.

Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined (by this specification) to have certain meanings (semantics). For example, the ol element represents an ordered list, and the lang attribute represents the language of the content.

These definitions allow HTML processors, such as Web browsers or search engines, to present and use documents and applications in a wide variety of contexts that the author might not have considered.

Code Example:

&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;My Page&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my page&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I like cars and lorries and have a big Jeep!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Where I live&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I live in a small hut on a mountain!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

3.2.3 Element definitions

Each element in this specification has to have a definition that includes the following information:

Categories
Contexts in which this element can be used
Content model
Tag omission in text/html
Content attributes


Warning: Otherwise it is not valid!

3.3 Content models

Each element defined in this specification has a content model: a description of the element's expected contents. An HTML element must have contents that match the requirements described in the element's content model. The contents of an element are its children in the DOM, except for template elements, where the children are those in the template contents (a separate DocumentFragment assigned to the element when the element is created).
